## TStarJetPicoMaker

### 2022.04.23

This repository has last been updated largely with the garduation of N. Elsey some years ago. 
A local copy by I. Mooney has been used (but not, I think, I fork). We (V. Verkest and D. Stewart)
to make trees, perhaps for the last time, for this STAR data. This is a work to update these.

**STAR Collaboration**

**Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, BNL**

Produces TStarJetPico root files from STAR muDSTs, Will provide implementation
for PicoDSTs as they come online at BNL. The old StMuJetAnalysisTreeMaker is
provided for backwards compatibility, testing & comparison, but shouldn't be
used going forward as there are bugs that are fixed in the new Maker.


These libraries require the root4star framework. Additionally, we use
[StRefMultCorr](https://github.com/GuannanXie/Run14AuAu200GeV_StRefMultCorr.git)
and [eventStructuredAu](https://github.com/kkauder/eventStructuredAu.git).
Versions that are compatible with the Maker are embedded in StRoot already. If
you want to update, they are kept as submodules in external/. You can
initialize the submodules via ```git submodule update --init --recursive```

## Usage

After cloning the repository, you can use  

```
./macros/configure.sh
```

to create some needed directories. Compile the libraries via  

```
./macros/compile.csh
```

You can play around with some of the scripts in sandbox/, where everything is
in a single directory. You must fill a file named test.list with valid muDST
file paths first to use the scripts provided.
